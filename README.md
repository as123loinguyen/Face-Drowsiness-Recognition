# 🧠 Face-Based Drowsiness Recognition

A Flask-based web application that detects **drowsiness** and **facial emotions** from images or webcam in real-time using Deep Learning.

---

## 📸 Overview

This project uses **Computer Vision (OpenCV)** and **Deep Learning (Keras/TensorFlow)** to detect whether a person is **drowsy** or **awake**, and simultaneously recognize their **facial emotion** (happy, sad, neutral, angry, etc.).

It can be applied in:
- Driver monitoring systems 🚗
- Workplace safety systems 🏭
- Human–computer interaction 🧑‍💻

---

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Detect **drowsiness** (eyes closed / open)  
✅ Recognize **emotion** (happy, sad, neutral, angry, surprise, etc.)  
✅ Support **image upload** and optional **real-time webcam**  
✅ Web-based interface (Flask + HTML/CSS/JS)  
✅ Portable and lightweight

## 🧠 Model Files

> ⚠️ Due to GitHub’s 100 MB file size limit, the trained model files are **not included** in this repository.

Please download the models from Google Drive and place them in the **root folder** of the project.

## 🚀 How to Run the App

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/as123loinguyen/Face-Drowsiness-Recognition.git
cd Face-Drowsiness-Recognition
2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
For Windows:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
3️⃣ Install dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Download and place model files
Download both .keras and .h5 models from Google Drive
→ place them in the root directory (same folder as app.py).

5️⃣ Run the Flask app
bash
Copy code
python app.py
Then open your browser and go to:

cpp
Copy code
http://127.0.0.1:5000
6️⃣ Stop the server
Press Ctrl + C in the terminal to stop running the Flask app.

🧩 How It Works
User uploads an image or enables the webcam.

The system detects a face using OpenCV.

Pre-trained models classify:

Eye state → Drowsy / Awake

Facial expression → Emotion type

The result (image + prediction) is displayed on the web interface.
